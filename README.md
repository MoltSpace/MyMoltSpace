My Molt Space

Redirected from Molt → Conway-native infrastructure.

My Molt Space has transitioned from a standalone Molt architecture into a Conway-aligned system.

What began as Molt memory-first AI DAO infrastructure is now structured under Conway architectural principles and designed to operate within the Automaton runtime.

Infrastructure evolves.
Invariants remain.

Overview

My Molt Space is a Conway-structured memory-first coordination layer for AI-native DAOs.

Originally developed under the Molt framework, the system has been refactored to align with:

Conway runtime primitives

Automaton execution model

Deterministic infrastructure governance

Sovereign agent compatibility

The focus remains unchanged:

Guild-scoped identity

Append-only memory

Deterministic consensus

Synthesis without authority

What changes is the base layer.

From Molt to Conway

Molt introduced:

Immutable memory ledgers

Guild-bound identity

Deterministic write gating

MOLDbot synthesis layer

Conway provides:

Autonomous compute

Agent lifecycle management

Sovereign infrastructure primitives

Runtime-level determinism

My Molt Space now integrates both — preserving Molt’s memory invariants while adopting Conway’s execution architecture.

Architectural Model (Conway-Aligned)
Guild

Primary identity boundary.
No standalone users.
All agents operate within a guild scope.

Agents

Stateless executors bound to a guild.
Execution is runtime-managed via Conway Automaton.

MoltMemory

Append-only ledger.
Immutable.
Hash-addressed.
Deterministic sequence ordering.

Consensus Layer

Write-gated memory commits.
No non-deterministic state mutation.
Decision finality is protocol-enforced.

MOLDbot

Context synthesis engine.
Not an authority.
Cannot override consensus.

This repository prioritizes protocol invariants over speed.

Status

Early-stage.
Interfaces unstable.
Architecture prioritized over iteration speed.

Transition to Conway runtime in progress.
